For validators in the DoubleZero Delegation Program (https://doublezero.xyz/journal/guide-to-the-doublezero-delegation-pool-dzdp), the two more important components that govern delegated stake are:
1) The amount of stake a validator brings onto the network
2) The "tenure," i.e. continuous connection to DoubleZero

This repo makes available a flat file to provide more transparency to the second of these. Using tenure.csv, each validator can look up the fraction of the day they were connected to DoubleZero mainnet-beta (or, prior to September 22, DoubleZero testnet).
